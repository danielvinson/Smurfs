I know my actions are probably annoying some lower rank individual who faces the same problem but until a solution is found, there isn't much I can think to do to end the cycle.

I don't know what rank that guy might have been, but his aim was vastly superior. It's a good practice for higher ranks, where you are not supposed do repeek often, change positions after every peek and stuff. It starts to become less of an issue. But in lower ranks (where smurfing is a lot more prevalent) it was mostly just a loss we had to wait out, which was the most exhausting buzzkill ever. "

Smurfs also can boost people to ranks they dont belong in thus further ruining the balance of matchmaking.

Matchmaking currently as it is is a circus. its a crapshoot. The skill level of players for any game I queue for is completely random. A close game is like once out off every 20."

How it affects people? Honestly if you want to get better the best way is to play against better opponents IMO, so giving them a challenge is probably helping them overall."

8/7/2015 21:34:33,Global Elite,Never,Yes,5,Multiple Smurfs,Distinguished Master Guardian,"When I smurf, I don't play just to rape the players who are so far below me. I play to help the players below me game sense wise. I tend to be called the ""Inferno Global"", because I only que that map. So, my game sense and knowledge on that particular map is obviously pretty good seeing as I'm still global by playing only 1 map. I help the lower players by teaching them good smokes and mollys, Effective pop flashes and taking and retaking of sites as well as holding them. I feel smurfs in a way is the majority of the time is made where ranks like Nova 1 will say will create a account a new account and go ahead and try to get ranked higher than what they already are. Like what I did. I was stuck in silver for ages and it got to the point where I felt as if I made a smurf account and try to start some what fresh, that I'd most likely get ranked much higher. Ended up getting ranked DMG. I switched over to that account from my main since I felt like my main was doomed silver forever and ever since then I just learned from playing with higher ranks. Now I play for  a CEVO-MAIN team and spend a little less on MM since I already achieved every ones fantasized rank haha. The new anti-smurf situation thats going on at the moment is horrendous. I feel like they should step their game up on the whole OVERWATCH system seeing as thats probably the 80% of the reason why they added the rank 3+ system and 2 comp matches a day, just to slow down the hackers so it gives OVERWATCH viewers enough time to ban the guy before he/she causes more havoc. I know I went sort of off topic, but that's my thoughts on how smurf impact our game play!"

I use one of them for drunk playing and honestly if I'm drunk enough to get on that account, then I probably will be playing to the level of a GN3, but most of the time when I use the OTHER smurf accounts which are both GN1, I'm q'ing with my friends that I bought CS for that just got into it and are low-silver.
